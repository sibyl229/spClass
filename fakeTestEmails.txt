08Jun is available at this time.  Would you like to change to 08Jun instead.... Air Canada Sold out for the return flights from 15Jun to 27Jun....That was a problem.  Therefore, I held flights under Korean instead.

For my my city here is not like Seoul in the sense it is very rural except near my school. So, we don;t have much to show to you. However, Seoul has many interesting places to see and Seoul is a very big city. So, let us make you to spend 12th night in Seoul and 13th night in Taejon (KAIST).

I thougt about this issue more. I think that we can have generalized framework for sequental pattern mining  algorithm.  The input sequence is a sequence of k-ary list. (e.g. <P1, S1, L1>) The type of each element in the list can be among three: Literal, Temporal,  Scalar.

you two have done a wonderful job with this. I have made a few changes (with some substantial editing in the related work section). Here's the revised version.

Email #36
well, I finally read it, have left a hard copy for you and think you did a wonderful job tying things together.  I don't know how much the sections missing will be needed.  I think sending it now and finishing those off to include is  good idea.  I may work on it over the weekend.

I'm a bit concerned that the instructional video section is taking things in a quite different direction from what we've discussed with Lucent (namely focusing on the learning of programming skills and concepts by teachers and students, with particular attention to women). I think we really need to keep the project fairly narrowly focused to have any hope of making this thing fly. Thus I would suggest that if we want to include the instructional video, it is done in a very short section as an example of other related new media tools that will used in teacher pre-service and in-service programs.

It was a productive day. Of course, we were missing our "quarterback". There were a few times that we were out of sync. For most of them, I think we recovered after spending some time to explain to each other. However, there are still some open issues. I think once you have recovered and caught up with your team and our summary, we should try to arrange a TC late this week or early next week.

The initial taxonomy for digital cameras looks good.  We need to develop a parallel taxonomy for another category to go through the learning process for adding a new category.  How about Software?  It's somewhat different from digital cameras, we could showcase a number of Microsoft products, and our current attribute extractor has some trouble performing in this category.

Email #44
Attached file contains the labeled data for digital camera. Please let me know if you have any question for it.  Besides that, could you please send me the software package names for the similarity matching algorithms?  I will start to investigate with them.

 We can provide an occurrence of a feature as: the feature + the review in which it occurred + the sentence in which it occurred, but as you know that the raw review data is huge and the feature-sentence mapping, sentence-review mapping table is also big. Could you tell me a way to share these data to you, or other ways which can help you get this information?

Thank you very much for your interest in the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver and we are delighted to hear that you have been successful and securing the ACM meeting. Vancouver as you know has a great delegate draw particularly in the spring and summer months.
We are in the midst of putting together your proposal and I have a few questions. 1) Do you have a particular day pattern in which the conference typically runs? 2) Are the 250 bedrooms per night based on single or double occupancy?

Thanks for the analysis. I will let J take a look at it and respond. At first glance, the food cost seems OK to me (total is about $154,000 for 500 people), but I am not sure of your 2.6 factor. I don't think this is right, but let us wait for J to comment. With this sort of food cost, the registration cost should be around $500-525. At this year's meeting, although we held it at the city's most expensive hotel, we were able to keep the registration at $600 Canadian (about US$500). You should also keep in mind that if the conference is at a hotel and we guarantee some room fullness level, we get the conference rooms free. I think in 2005, we are paying for them (but I am not sure, as I don't have the budget). We need to buy a few expensive items as well. So we need to watch the budget.
Email #48
You cannot justfy the 2.6 factor just from one year's budget. I believe the one I sent you is for 2002, where food was cheap and other costs are on par. Also, because of cheap food, David was able to use the extra money to use his school to handle registration and other stuff at $35 per person. We usually do it with RSL at less than $10.

I've attached a copy of our budget to help plan your conference.  This was our planned budget, as I don't have an actual list of our expenditures, as they were all handled out of the IEEE office.  I'm CCing Jim as well, as he may have some other information or suggestions to contribute. 
Email #50
I'll be happy to help. Our budget turned out to be very conservative (we made almost $140K!). Marina will be producing soon our final report and I'll be happy to send it to you (along with details about all the breaks we got.)

WINTHER represents a breakthrough concept compared to current oncology practice, which at best offers personalized, biology-guided therapy to the 30-40% of patients who harbor known tumor DNA aberrations, and for whom targeted therapy is available. WINTHER's novel approach comprehensively investigates DNA, and RNA from dual biopsies of tumor, and matched normal tissue of the same histology for each patient. This data is examined by an algorithm-driven bioinformatics tool, to provide a predictive efficacy score for all existing drugs for each individual patient.

Application discovery and dependency mapping (ADDM) solutions automate the process of discovering and mapping transactions and applications to the underlying infrastructure. The service models created by ADDM solutions then become invaluable tools for supporting many aspects of datacenter management. Riverbed® Cascade® is an application-aware network performance management solution with built-in ADDM capabilities.
